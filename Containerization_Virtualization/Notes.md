| Containers are an abstraction at the app layer                                                                                                                | Virtual machines are an abstraction of the hardware                                                                                                                                      |
| Containers are `lightweight` as they are using multiple containers for each of the application on the Host OS.                                                | Virtual machines uses `hypervisor` which allows to create multiple VMs with respective OS environment for each of the application on the Host OS which makes this process `heavyweight`. |
| It does not provide `Isolation` for each application as they are sharing common OS.                                                                           | Virtual Machines provides `Isolation` to each application as each application has its own environment and OS configuration.                                                              |
| Since each container is a package of application, its dependencies, configurations which makes application suitable for running on different machines easily. | Virtual Machines does not provide this flexibility which makes a big issue here.                                                                                                         |
| This is a `low cost` and `scalable` process.                                                                                                                  | This is a `High cost` and `scalable` process.                                                                                                                                            |
| It is `Less Secure` as Single Host OS is shared among multiple containers.                                                                                    | It is `highly secure` as each application has its own OS.                                                                                                                                |
| It is `Less Fault taulrent` as failure on Host OS can cause failure in all containers.                                                                        | It is `High Fault taulrent` as failure of an application OS can not cause failure in other application environments.                                                                     |
| Examples: `Docker`, `Kubernetes` etc. and `Docker` is widely used.                                                                                            | Examples: `Vmware`, `VirtualBox` etc.                                                                                                                                                    |
