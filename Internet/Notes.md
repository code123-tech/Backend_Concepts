#### How does the Internet work?
##### Internet?
- Internet is connection of computers over global network so that they can communicate to each other through some set of protocols.
- Now, this communication can happen through anything like wires, cables or wi-fi (in form of e-waves)
- The transmission happens in form of packets (set of bits).

##### Protocols?   
- Network Protocol is a set of rules that governs the communication between computers over a network.
- Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules governing the format of data sent over the Internet or other network.
- IP address is a unique address given to each device connected to the internet.
- IP address is a 32bit number (IPv4) or 128bit number (IPv6) written in decimal form.
- DNS stands for Domain Name System
- DNS is a naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the internet or a private network
- DNS is used to translate domain names to IP addresses.
- There are different DNS servers for different domains. such as .com, .org, .net, .in, .uk, .edu, .gov, etc.

##### Packets, Routing, and Reliability
- Packets are small chunks of data that are sent over the internet.
- Each Packet follows a different route to reach the destination.
- Router helps the packet to travel from one network to another.
- TCP is another protocol that is used to ensure that the packets are sent reliably and in order.
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it requires handshaking to set up end-to-end communications.
- TCP is used by application layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Telnet, and others.
- TCP acknowledges the packets that are sent and received.

##### HTTP and HTML
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- It's a language that allows web clients and servers to communicate with each other.
- HTTP is a request-response protocol.
- HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
- HTML tells your browser, "How to represent information/pages received from the server".
- HTTPs is a secure version of HTTP.
- HTTPs uses SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.

##### Encryption and Public Keys
- Encryption is the process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it.
- Encryption is used to protect data from being accessed by unauthorized users.
- It uses Public and Private keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- Public key is used to encrypt the data and Private key is used to decrypt the data.
- Public key is shared with everyone and Private key is kept secret.
